# Low-level programming & Algorithm

Module of **Low-level programming** and **algorithm**, carried out during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **[Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/)**.

## Technologies

* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Projects

All of the following folders are projects done during the studies:
