`2-mul.c` : A function that multiplies two integers.<br/>
`3-print_numbers.c` : A function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.<br/>
`4-print_most_numbers.c` : A function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.<br/>
`5-more_numbers.c` : A function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.<br/>
`6-print_line.c` : A function that draws a straight line in the terminal. <br/>
`7-print_diagonal.c` : A function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.<br/>
`8-print_square.c` : A function that prints a square, followed by a new line.<br/>
